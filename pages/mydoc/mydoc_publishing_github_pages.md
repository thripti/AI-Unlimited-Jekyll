summary: "You can publish your project on Github Pages, which is a free web hosting service provided by Github. All you need is to put your content into a Github repo branch called gh-pages and make this your default branch in your repo. With a Jekyll site, you just commit your entire project into the gh-pages branch and Github Pages will build the site for you."
