title: Excluding files
tags: [single_sourcing]
last_updated: July 3, 2016
keywords: exclusion, separating outputs, removing files from outputs
summary: "By default, all the files in your Jekyll project are included in the output (this differs from DITA projects, which don't include files unless noted on the map). If you're single sourcing, you'll need to exclude the files that shouldn't be included in the output. The sidebar doesn't control inclusion or exclusion."
