summary: "You can loop through files and generate a JSON file that developers can consume like a help API. Developers can pull in values from the JSON into interface elements, styling them as popovers for user interface text, for example. The beauty of this method is that the UI text remains in the help system (or at least in a single JSON file delivered to the dev team) and isn't hard-coded into the UI."
