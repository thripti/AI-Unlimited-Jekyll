summary: "You can generate a PDF from your Jekyll project. You do this by creating a web version of your project that is printer friendly. You then use utility called Prince to iterate through the pages and create a PDF from them. It works quite well and gives you complete control to customize the PDF output through CSS, including page directives and dynamic tags from Prince."
